## First Systems project/small projects
I am trying to complete the projects/assignments from the site:<br> https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/Classes/CS537-F07/projects.html<br>
<ol>
  <li><b><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/Classes/CS537-F07/Projects/P1/p1.html">The Unix Shell</a>:</b></li> This was an assignment. The file <code>wisc_shell.cpp</code> has the solution to it. The assignment mentions code to be written in C, but I don't know C, so I implemented it in C++.
  <li><b><a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/Classes/CS537-F07/Projects/P2/p2.html">Multi-Threaded Web Servers</a>:</b></li> I will start this now.
</ol>
